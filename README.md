# Image-Classification
Different Image Classification Methodologies
Image Classification has been one of the tasks that CNNs have always been great at. The famous architectures like Inception-V3 and VGG-16 perform best in the big data regime. In use cases like Medical Imaging procuring labelled data has always been a challaging task. Hence the methods employed when the dataset is not very large one are Transfer Learning, Fine-Tuning. Inspired from the blog-post by fchollet on Keras for small datasets and few other sources this repo has some basic classifiaction code.
The Files and the Summary:
CNN_from_scratch.py ---------------  This is firstly epxerimenting with data on a simple 3 layer CNN and training it from Scratch to obtain prilimnary Classification Results.
transfer_learning_svm.py ----------- This one gives uses Deep CNN for feature Extraction and Classification is done using a Linear Classifier SVM.
